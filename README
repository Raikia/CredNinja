                    v2.0 (Built 6/24/2016) - Chris King (@raikiasec)

                         For help: ./CredNinja.py -h

usage: CredNinja.py -a accounts_to_test.txt -s systems_to_test.txt
                    [-t THREADS] [--ntlm] [--valid] [--invalid] [-o OUTPUT]
                    [-p PASSDELIMITER] [--delay SECONDS %JITTER]
                    [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--stripe] [--scan]
                    [--scan-timeout SCAN_TIMEOUT] [-h] [--no-color] [--os]
                    [--domain] [--users] [--users-time USERS_TIME]

Quickly check the validity of multiple user credentials across multiple
servers and be notified if that user has local administrator rights on each
server.

Required Arguments:
  -a accounts_to_test.txt, --accounts accounts_to_test.txt
                        A word or file of user credentials to test. Usernames
                        are accepted in the form of "DOMAIN\USERNAME:PASSWORD"
  -s systems_to_test.txt, --servers systems_to_test.txt
                        A word or file of servers to test against. Each
                        credential will be tested against each of these
                        servers by attempting to browse C$ via SMB

Optional Arguments:
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads to use. Defaults to 10
  --ntlm                Treat the passwords as NTLM hashes and attempt to
                        pass-the-hash!
  --valid               Only print valid/local admin credentials
  --invalid             Only print invalid credentials
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Print results to a file
  -p PASSDELIMITER, --passdelimiter PASSDELIMITER
                        Change the delimiter between the account username and
                        password. Defaults to ":"
  --delay SECONDS %JITTER
                        Delay each request per thread by specified seconds
                        with jitter (example: --delay 20 10, 20 second delay
                        with 10% jitter)
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Amount of seconds wait for data before timing out.
                        Default is 15 seconds
  --stripe              Only test one credential on one host to avoid spamming
                        a single system with multiple login attempts (used to
                        check validity of credentials). This will randomly
                        select hosts from the provided host file.
  --scan                Perform a quick check to see port 445 is available on
                        the host before queueing it up to be processed
  --scan-timeout SCAN_TIMEOUT
                        Sets the timeout for the scan specified by --scan
                        argument. Default of 2 seconds
  -h, --help            Get help about this script's usage
  --no-color            Turns off output color. Written file is always
                        colorless

Additional Information Retrieval:
  --os                  Display the OS of the system if available (no extra
                        request is being sent)
  --domain              Display the primary domain of the system if available
                        (no extra request is being sent)
  --users               List the users that have logged in to the system in
                        the last 6 months (requires LOCAL ADMIN). Returns
                        usernames with the number of days since their home
                        directory was changed. This sends one extra request to
                        each host
  --users-time USERS_TIME
                        Modifies --users to search for users that have logged
                        in within the last supplied amount of days (default
                        100 days)










Changelog:

   v2.0 - Initial release of CredNinja from the predecessor CredSwissArmy:

	* Same ability as the previous CredSwissArmy (using credentials and host list
	  to search for Local Admin access across a network via SMB)
        * Fully multithreaded!  It is 8x the speed of the old CredSwissArmy!
        * Handles errors and complex passwords much better
        * Can still pass-the-hash with the "--ntlm" option
        * Still has the same arguments as before
        * Added "--timeout", which allows scans to get done faster if you wish
        * Added "--scan", which runs a quick port 445 scan of the hosts to make sure 
	  they are connectable before trying creds on them
        * Added "--stripe", which tests each credential once across a random system 
	  (used to validate credentials without appearing suspicious in one systems' 
	  event log)
        * Added "--delay", which allows you to specify a delay between scanning hosts 
	  to be more covert.  "--delay 10 20" will delay for 10 seconds with a 20% 
	  jitter (so between 8-10 seconds)
        * Added color output so its more obvious when you get success!

	AND NOW THE COOL ADDITIONS

        * Added "--os", which shows the operating system of each system that it can 
	  fingerprint (no additional packet is sent to target host)
        * Added "--domain", which shows the primary domain the system is a member of 
	  (no additional packet is sent to the target host)
        * Added "--users", which shows a list of users' whose home directories have 
	  been modified in X amount of days (X is modifiable by "--users-days", default 
	  of 100). Basically an SMB User-Hunter that shows where users are logged in to 
	  or have been logged in to  (1 additional packet is sent to each target host)
        * Coming soon: Anti-virus detector to give notice to potential antivirus running 
	  on the system
